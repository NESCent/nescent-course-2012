It was a dark and stormy nite.
And I forgot an umbrella. Melissa's cat Harold is sleeping.

The rain falling on your face…The roar of the tyrannosaur woke the cat up and it jumped off the sofa.
 The cat scratched my face on the way off the coutch, it hurt me.
Your mother.
 That was a strange dream, must stop eating so late at night!
Or stop sleeping when I'm eating.
