####### Immediate needs

#phenex working on windows7
#visual representation of osteology of TAO (to compare to my own cmap)
#characters alignment (are my characters already referenced in phenoscape/TAO?)
#integration of my data (drawings/pictures) in existing ontology (TAO?)
#nexus to owl (datamatrix to ontology)
#how to do post-composition to match your own characters and character states
from several ontologies (TAO/PATO/BFO/phenoscape?) -- how to make query like
"(seta and white) and (head)" and manchester notation for queries across
several ontologies
#how to "code" an instance (e.g. such taxon has white seta)?


####### Long term goals:

#formalization of character description (we all talk about the same entities/concepts)
#workbench (annotation, pictures, character descriptions, to work in group)
#public access of data (load ontology on lab website)

#use of ontology for species diagnoses (possible?)
